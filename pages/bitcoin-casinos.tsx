                  Bitcoin gambling is a fantastic way to gamble in the US as the
                  deposits and withdrawals are easier and faster than with any
                  other method available to US residents. Also, apart from
                  winning in the casino you can benefit from the Bitcoin price
                  rise and therefore grow your crypto portfolio! So, choose a
                  bitcoin casino from the comprehensive list below. All of them
                  have some welcome offer you&apos;ll want to take advantage of,
                  and you&apos;ll double your Bitcoin in no time if you claim
                  one of those offers. There are casinos that give out Bitcoin
                  no deposit bonuses and Bitcoin free spins, so you can start
                  gambling in Bitcoin even if you don&apos;t currently have any
                  crypto. Of course, you&apos;ll get the most bang for your buck
                  if you take advantage one of the Bitcoin welcome bonuses as
                  they are the most rewarding.

                <b>Why gamble in Bitcoin?</b>{" "}
                  When you&apos;re gambling in Bitcoin you never have to worry
                  about your deposit or withdrawal being blocked. You&apos;re
                  off the grid, the transactions are done on the decentralized
                  blockchain, and that&apos;s the safest way to move funds. Most
                  casinos will instantly convert your Bitcoin deposit to USD,
                  therefore Bitcoin is only a vessel for transferring money, and
                  you&apos;ll still be gambling in dollars. Some casinos allow
                  gambling directly in Bitcoin.

                <p className="p-4">
                <b>How to buy Bitcoin</b>{" "}
                  The easiest way to buy Bitcoin is to head over to one of the
                  crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Crypto.com or Gemini. You
                  deposit USD and buy any cryptocurrency you like, including
                  Bitcoin. After you do that, Bitcoin will be in your wallet and
                  you can freely send it to an online casino that accepts
                  Bitcoin deposits, and then bring it back from the casino to
                  your wallet when you want.{" "}
                </p>
                <p className="p-4"><b>Bitcoin casino payouts, deposits and fees.{" "}</b>
                
                  Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals are faster than with any
                  other payment method. The only waiting time is when the casino
                  is verifying the transaction. Over the past year or so,
                  Bitcoin transaction fees were steady at around $2. Most of the
                  time the fee per transaction is between $1.50 and $2.50 so
                  that&apos;s what you can expect to pay whenever you send
                  Bitcoin somewhere. This is very affordable, especially if you
                  transfer a lot of funds. With higher amounts, Bitcoin is
                  absolutely the cheapest way to move money, as the transaction
                  fee is fixed and doesn&apos;t depend on the amount you send.
                  Some casinos even pay the fee on your behalf and therefore let
                  you withdraw your Bitcoin absolutely free, though the usual
                  $1.50-2.50 fee per transaction isn&apos;t much either. Pay
                  attention to the exchange rate and any applicable fees when
                  you&apos;re buying and selling Bitcoin at an exchange, though.
                  Fees will also apply when you&apos;ve converted your Bitcoin
                  to USD and are withdrawing USD to your bank account.
