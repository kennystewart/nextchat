          <strong>26. Dispute Resolution</strong>
        </p>

        <p>

          any dispute, claim, or controversy you may have arising out of or
          relating to the Site, Services, or these Terms will be resolved

          Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Commercial
          Arbitration Rules, and the judgment of its arbitrator(s) may be
          entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. You further agree that
          the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
          enforcement of this provision, and THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT EACH

        <p>
          You and AFC Media LLC agree that we may seek injunctive or other
          appropriate relief in the appropriate state or federal court should
          you violate or threaten to violate the intellectual property rights of
          us or our subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, suppliers, or licensors,
          and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>27. General Terms</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          a. Entire Agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          These Terms and our Privacy Policy represent the entire and exclusive
          agreement between you and AFC Media LLC regarding your use of the Site
          and Services, superseding and replacing all previous agreements. You
          may also be subject to additional terms and conditions or separate
          agreements regarding specific Services we provide, partner or
          affiliate services, use of Third-Party Resources, or any purchases you
          may make through the
          Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          In the event that these Terms are translated into other languages and
          there is a discrepancy between the two language versions, the English
          language version will prevail in all cases to the extent that such
          discrepancy is the result of an error in translation.
        </p>

        <p>
          b. Waiver and Severability&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
          operate as a waiver of such right or
          provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          If any provision of these Terms or the application thereof is held to
          be invalid or unenforceable for any reason and to any extent, that
          provision will be considered removed from these Terms; however, the
          remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable
          according to the intentions of the Parties and to the maximum extent
          permitted by law. If it is held that any provision of these Terms is
          invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would
          become valid and enforceable, then such provision will be deemed to be
          written, construed, and enforced as so limited.
        </p>

        <p>
          c. Assignment
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          Your rights and obligations under these Terms, including any accounts,

          <br />
          &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          All websites need to post their online terms and conditions in order
          to notify visitors of its rules and protect themselves from a wide
          variety of potential legal liabilities. The following information
          explains the main sections and key considerations of online terms and
          conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            Note that this document is meant for websites based within the
            United States. It may not be appropriate for sites hosted in other

        <p>
          <strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This section explains that, by using the website and any services
          provided, the visitor agrees to abide by the terms and conditions.
          These terms are a binding legal agreement. Also, the section specifies
          any age restrictions you impose on visitors.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Browsewrap vs. Clickwrap</u>
        </p>

        <p>
          &quot;Browsewrap&quot; is the term used for websites that allow users
          to accept their terms and conditions simply by navigating through the
          site. &quot;Clickwrap,&quot; on the other hand, refers to sites that
          require visitors to affirmatively agree to the terms by clicking an
          &quot;Accept&quot; button, or checking a similar box, before creating
          an account or making a purchase.
        </p>

        <p>
          Browsewrap is typically only used for static sites that are primarily
          informational in nature with little to no interaction with the site or
          others and do not offer products or services for sale. Clickwrap is
          recommended for all sites that go beyond browsewrap by selling
          products and services or allowing users to post content or interact
          with others.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose to implement clickwrap, you should be sure that your
          method requires visitors to make an affirmative action assenting to
          the terms and conditions. Best practice is to require visitors to scroll through the entire terms
          (and privacy policy, if you have one) before they can click the button
          or box to agre.
        </p>

        <p>

          visitors, you own all intellectual property rights to the content on

        <p>
          <strong>Copyright Policy</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This section outlines the process for reporting any allegations of
          copyright infringement on your website according to the proper
          procedure outlined under 17 U.S.C. 512(c) and then designates your
          copyright agent responsible for receiving and investigating such
          notices. This information is necessary to comply with the safe harbor
          provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)

          proper &quot;counter-notice,&quot; and complying with applicable
          procedures thereafter, and (c) designate an agent to receive notices
          of infringement from copyright owners.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Sales, Refund, and Cancellation Policies</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you sell goods or services through your website, then you should
          outline your sales policy in this section, including any conditions of
          sale, return policies, guarantees, payment details, fees, and shipping
          terms. Doing so helps avoid potential disputes and lawsuits with
          aggrieved visitors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Likewise, you should include any refund and cancellation policies you
          may have in order to put visitors on notice and avoid conflicts.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Disclaimers</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          The disclaimers include many of your most important terms and
          conditions. Among these, visitors are told that the site is provided
          on an &quot;as-is&quot; basis, and potential express and implied
          warranties are disclaimed in order to prevent visitors from seeking to
          hold you liable for promises you do not intend to offer. This also
          includes disclaimers for any loss or damages that may occur to
          visitors&#39; computers, internet connections, or User Content.
        </p>

        <p>
          Visitors are told that the content on your website is for
          informational purposes only and does not offer any professional
          advice, including legal, financial, or medical advice.
        </p>

          <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
        </p>

        <p>

          months.
        </p>

          your subsidiaries, officers, employees, contractors, agents,
          affiliates, partners, suppliers, or licensors.

          claims by third parties that result from visitors&#39; use of the
          site.
        </p>

        <p>

          you or your affiliates.

          site at any time in your sole discretion, without notice.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may also update these terms at any time. Visitors&#39; continued
          use of the site constitutes acceptance of such updates. You will
          provide visitors with notice of such updates by any reasonable means,
          including by email or posting notice in a prominent place on the site.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Violation of These Terms</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          You have the right to take any and all appropriate actions you deem
          necessary should a visitor breach these terms. This may include
          suspending, blocking, or terminating their access.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose to include this option, all disputes relating to the
          site, services, or these terms are required to be resolved through
          mandatory binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
          Association.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Feedback and Complaints</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Visitors assign you the right to use and fully exploit all feedback or
          complaints they submit in any manner you wish, commercial or
          otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Contact Information</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          The last section includes the website operator&#39;s contact
          information, which is an important requirement that helps visitors
          report any violations of your terms that they may witness and to contact you for help and other matters.
